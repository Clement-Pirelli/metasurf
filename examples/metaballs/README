metasurf example: metaballs

- move the active metaball with the spaceball or the mouse
- move the camera with the mouse by pressing any modifier (shift/ctrl/alt/whatever)
- spaceball buttons or spacebar on the keyboard changes the active metaball
- toggle fullscreen with the 'f' key
- pass -s on the command line for stereoscopic rendering (then toggle with the 's' key)

If you're on an old system which doesn't support GLSL shaders, uncomment the
"nosdr = ..." line in the Makefile.
