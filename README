metasurf - a library for implicit surface polygonization

1. Overview
-----------

Metasurf is a library for implict surface polygonization. You only need to
set a callback that returns the scalar field value at any given point in
3-space, and another callback to accept isosurface vertices. Then at any point
just call msurf_polygonize, and the library handles everything else for you.

2. Usage
--------
The following snippet is sufficient to draw the surface of an implicit unit
sphere, centered around the origin.

     struct metasurface *ms;
     
     /* initialization */
     ms = msurf_create();
     msurf_eval_func(ms, eval);
     msurf_vertex_func(ms, glVertex3f);
     
     /* drawing */
     glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);
     msurf_polygonize(ms);
     glEnd();
     
     /* evaluator */
     float eval(float x, float y, float z)
     {
         return (x * x + y * y + z * z) - 1.0;
     }
