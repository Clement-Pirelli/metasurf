metasurf - a library for implicit surface polygonization
========================================================

Overview
--------
Metasurf is a library for implict surface polygonization. See
`examples/metaballs` for how to use it, and refer to the `metasurf2.h` header
file.

Other examples might be out of date at this moment, since the library is
currently transitioning from the metasurf-1.0 API, which was extremely simple
but very inefficient, to the v2 API which is somewhat more verbose, but
significantly more efficient.
